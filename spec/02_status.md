## Status of This Document

DID Registration is a draft specification under development within the
[Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation) (DIF (DIF), and designed to incorporate the
requirements and learnings from related work of the most active industry players
into a shared specification that meets the collective needs of the community.
This spec is regularly updated to reflect relevant changes, and we encourage
active engagement on GitHub (see above) and other mediums (e.g. DIF) where this
work is being done.
